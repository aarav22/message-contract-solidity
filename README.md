Solidity Contract- Wrote a solidity contract in Remix to implement the Fab-chat   application with the
following modification: 
Users are allowed to register by providing usernames
he contract allows users to post non-anonymous messages free of cost, but anonymous messages by paying a certain amount of fee (funding the contract).
Users are also allowed to flag already posted messages (both types).
A non-anonymous message receiving a number of flags that is more than the number of registered users (who had posted some messages) is then removed
An anonymous message receiving a number of flags that is more than the number of registered users (who had posted some messages) is made non-anonymous, i.e., username is revealed.
    Finally, deployed the contract on Ethereumâ€™s Ropsten network.
